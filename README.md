# Instagram-User-Analytics

The objective of this project is to analyze and extract valuable business insights to assist the Marketing team and Investors in making informed decisions. With access to a robust dataset and using MySQL queries, I have been able to derive following information:

-People who have been using the platform for the longest time.

-Inactive users who have never posted a single photo on Instagram. 

-Contest winner who got the most likes on a single photo.

-Which hashtags to use in the post to reach the most people on the platform.

-Which day most users register on and would be the best day to launch ADs. 

-Average posts per user on Instagram.

-Found the users (bots) who have liked every single photo on the site (since any normal user would not be able to do this).
